    <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
    <p>
      The world is filled with so much good and our lives may hold many adventures. At the same time, these adventures
      can take a turn for the worse and expose us to dangerous situations in which we may fear for our lives. In these
      moments, you may not have time to make a phone call or relate a situation to emergency services and thats where
      this discrete App comes in handy. If you are feeling threatened or scared for your life, you just have to press
      one button
      and authorities are notified of an 'incident' and are given your GPS location, name, email, phone number, and a
      safeword. If contacted and no one answers with the safeword or does answer but does not repeat the safeword, then
      authorities will be on their way to your location.
